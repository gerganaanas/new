# Individual Project
## To run the py code files it is necessary to ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed by checking python --version or python3 --version in the terminal. Then, install the necessary packages by running ‘pip install torch torchvision matplotlib streamlit numpy pillow cryptography’ (or pip3 install ... if you use multiple Python versions). This is when working with only CPU, which is how this code was developed. If you want GPU support, follow the installation instructions on the official PyTorch website to match your CUDA version. These packages are all needed for the final file to work properly, and once installed, your imports and other dependencies will run without errors.
